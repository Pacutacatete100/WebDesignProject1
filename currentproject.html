						This is a tic-tac-toe game my friend Olivia showed me. The way you play is the first player
						places their piece on any square. The next player must play their piece in the corresponding
						square on the bigger grid. This project is still in progress, the graphics and the clicking
						functionality is done, all thats missing is the game logic.
